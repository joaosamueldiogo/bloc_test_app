# bloc_test_app

A small sample Flutter app that is part of a case study exploring Bloc as a state management solution. The project is intended to be a simple, easy-to-read playground to test architecture choices, provider patterns, and the capabilities of Bloc in a realistic but minimal app scenario.

## Purpose

This repository is a case study:
- To evaluate Bloc patterns.
- To test how different state management architectures affect testability.

## Goals

- Keep the app intentionally small and focused on state-management concerns.
- Demonstrate clean separation of concerns (UI, logic, data).

## Resources

- Bloc documentation: [https://bloc.dev](https://bloclibrary.dev/)
